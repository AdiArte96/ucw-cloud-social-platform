# UCW Cloud Social Networking Platform 🌐☁️

This project is a **cloud-native social networking platform** developed as part of our MBA Cloud Computing course at University Canada West. It is designed specifically for UCW students to connect, collaborate, and share updates in a secure, scalable environment.

## 🧩 Project Objective

The goal was to architect and simulate deployment of a robust, scalable, and cost-efficient web application using **AWS services**, aligning with real-world cloud design principles.

## 🛠️ Technologies & AWS Services Used

- **EC2** – Hosting web application servers
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** – Distributing traffic across instances
- **Auto Scaling Groups (ASG)** – Ensuring performance under load
- **S3** – Static asset storage
- **RDS** – Database backend
- **IAM Roles/Policies** – Security and access management
- **CloudWatch** – Monitoring metrics and logs
- **AWS Lambda** – Serverless automation
- **Route 53** – DNS management (planned)
- **VPC** – Isolated networking environment

## 👨‍💻 Team & Contributions

- **Aditya Arte** – AWS infrastructure, IAM, Lambda automation, documentation
- Other team members – VPC, S3 setup, testing, and reporting

---

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Multi-AZ deployment with subnets
- Role-based access control using IAM
- Log monitoring and metric alarms with CloudWatch

---

## 🚀 Outcome

This cloud deployment plan mirrors production-grade web architectures and provided hands-on experience in integrating multiple AWS components under one scalable, secure platform.
